# Setup

The most important thing in E2E Testing is that it uses a separate configuration file and command to execute.
If you haven't read the [Module Design](../concepts-and-designs/module-design.md), recommend read this document first.

* [Installation](Install.md)
* [Configuration file](Configuration-File.md)
* [Run E2E Tests](Run-E2E-Tests.md)
